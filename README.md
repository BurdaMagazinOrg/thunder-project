# Composer template for Drupal Thunder projects based on drupal-composer/drupal-project

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you want to know how to use it as replacement for
[Drush Make](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/docs/make.md) visit
the [Documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2471553).

## Usage

First you need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) and [Node](https://nodejs.org).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project burdamagazinorg/thunder-project MYPROJECT --stability dev --no-interaction
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your 
installation.

```
cd MYPROJECT
composer require drupal/devel:1.*
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the 
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit 
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `docroot`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`docroot/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `docroot/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `docroot/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `docroot/profiles/contrib/`
* Downloads Drupal scaffold files such as `index.php`, or `.htaccess`
* Creates `sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `bin/drupal`.

## Installing Thunder

Create project will install thunder into the docroot direcrory inside of MYPROJECT. You can now install thunder as you would with any Drupal 8 site. See: [Drupal installation guide](https://www.drupal.org/node/1839310).
 
## Updating Thunder

To update Thunder, Drupal or any module to the newest version, constrained by the specified version in `composer.json`, execute `composer update`. This command will check every dependency for a new version, downloads it and updates the `composer.lock` accordingly.
After that you can run `drush updb` in the docroot folder to update the database of your site.

### File update

This project will attempt to keep all of your Thunder and drupal core files up-to-date; the 
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) 
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is 
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess), 
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modfied files are updated in a 
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your thunder files.

1. Run `composer update burdamagazinorg/thunder`
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed. 
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to 
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.
1. In the event that there are non-trivial conflicts in step 2, you may wish 
   to perform these steps on a branch, and use `git merge` to combine the 
   updated core files with your customized files. This facilitates the use 
   of a [three-way merge tool such as kdiff3](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-setup-kdiff-as-diff-tool-for-git.html). This setup is not necessary if your changes are simple; 
   keeping all of your modifications at the beginning or end of the file is a 
   good strategy to keep merges easy.

## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also 
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull 
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the 
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra 
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

### How can I prevent downloading modules from thunder, that I do not need?

To prevent downloading a module, that Thunder provides but that you do not need, add a replace block to your composer.json:

```json
"replace": {
    "drupal/features": "*"
}
```

This example prevents any version of the feature module to be downloaded.
